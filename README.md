# Py-Twitter

Takes _Clippings_ made on an Amazon Kindle and Tweets them. 

It should:

- Maintain a log of which clippings have already been tweeted and which haven't
- Be able to read the clippings file and push everything into a DB (or update if necessary)
  - would be great to have a warning if clipping exceeds twitter limit
- Have an option to simply _tweet_ the latest non-tweeted clipping (if any)
